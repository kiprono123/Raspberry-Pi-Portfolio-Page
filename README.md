Processor: Raspberry Pi uses Broadcom BCM2835 system on chip which is an ARM processor and Video core Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). It is the heart of the Raspberry Pi which controls the operations of all the connected devices and handles all the required computations.

HDMI: High Definition Multimedia Interface is used for transmitting video or digital audio data to a computer monitor or to digital TV. This HDMI port helps Raspberry Pi to connect its signals to any digital device such as a monitor digital TV or display through an HDMI cable.

GPIO ports: General Purpose Input Output ports are available on Raspberry Pi which allows the user to interface various I/P devices.

Audio output: An audio connector is available for connecting audio output devices such as headphones and speakers.

USB ports: This is a common port available for various peripherals such as a mouse, keyboard, or any other I/P device. With the help of a USB port, the system can be expanded by connecting more peripherals.

SD card: The SD card slot is available on Raspberry Pi. An SD card with an operating system installed is required for booting the device.

Ethernet: The ethernet connector allows access to the wired network, it is available only on the model B of Raspberry Pi.

Power supply: A micro USB power connector is available onto which a 5V power supply can be connected.

Camera module: Camera Serial Interface (CSI) connects the Broadcom processor to the Pi camera. 

Display: Display Serial Interface (DSI) is used for connecting LCD to Raspberry Pi using 15 15-pin ribbon cables. DSI provides a high-resolution display interface that is specifically used for sending video data.

Speaker: To enable sound output, this speaker may be linked to the Raspberry Pi.

Color Sensor: Colors may be detected by the Lego Spike's color sensor.

Temperature Sensor: This low-power instrument has the ability to sense temperature. In essence, it's a thermometer.

Powered Lego Wheel: The package does not include this Lego wheel. It is comparable to the PiWheel, which is made for the Raspberry Pi, though. But in contrast, the Lego wheel moves more slowly.

Camera Module: The Raspberry Pi is intended to use this 8 megapixel camera.

Wii remote control.

NeoPixel Stick: Depending on how the user configures it, the LEDs that make up the neopixel stick can show different colors.

Raspberry Pi Build Hat: To enable more Raspberry Pi connections, this device may be connected to the 40 pin GPIO. UltraSonic Distance Sensor: This gadget uses ultrasonic waves to detect distance. The time it takes for a wave to strike an object and return to the sensor is how it calculates distance.

For additional connections, use a 20-pin connector.
